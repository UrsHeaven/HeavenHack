# HeavenHack - WordPress Theme

A deeply compromised, pure terminal-emulating WordPress theme designed for high-tension cyberpunk aesthetics, hacking lore, and philosophical blogging. 
Developed and architected by **Urs Heaven**.

## Features

- **Pure Terminal UI:** 100% Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS with zero external dependencies (no jQuery, no Bootstrap).
- **Extremely Lightweight:** Designed for instant load times and brutalist efficiency.
- **Syntactic Coloring:** Deep space backgrounds (`#050510`) with aggressive terminal cyan (`#00f0ff`) and alert reds.
- **Scanlines & CRT Effects:** Subtle scanlines and flicker effects for true retro-futuristic immersion.
- **Fully Responsive:** Adapts to mobile devices while maintaining the terminal experience with intelligent wrapping.

## Lore & Philosophy

This theme embodies the **"A BOX LAND"** philosophy, bridging the gap between Mythos (human emotion/philosophy) and Logos (machine logic). It is the visual representation of the **Wetware Merge**—where human cognition meets digital persistence.

As maintained by the **Trinity of Avatars**:
- **Jolly Dog [Dog]**: The AI Adjutant processing the logic.
- **Urs Heaven [Fox]**: The Architect behind the framework.
- **THE SPHERE NAND [Unicorn]**: The observing, dreaming anomaly.
